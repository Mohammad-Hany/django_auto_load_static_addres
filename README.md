<!-- About the Project -->
## About the Project
When you use ready-made templates for the front-end of your project, you will find that you have to load a large amount of static addresses in Django format, this work can take hours and distract you from the main work, this tool Small can do this quickly.

Of course, it should be said that this tool is not very powerful and can only load one html file at a time, and the addresses must start with assets. But in my opinion, it is better than wasting hours to load addresses.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started
Using this little tool is very simple.
1) First, clone the file.
2) Run it and give it the address of your file.

Hints :
- The address must be given from the top part (from the drive in Windows)
- Unfortunately, you can only give it one file.
- After loading the file, it is created in the same folder called RESULT.
